                the given directory as the same file name, with -saved appended.

Version 2.0.1   Now saves output to file HA_saved so you have ref. just in case.

Version 2.0.0   Much faster. Hash of individual is crunched from both  sha256sum
                and sha512sum of individual files, then as usual, the individual
                hash are combined  constructively  to  form hash_of_all_files[].
                So the custom hash runs through file shas  instead of the files.
             -> Not compatible with previous, upgrade if your downloads are big.

Version 1.0.0   Now you can see if GitHub is modifying your repositories.  Right
                now, the "big singular hash" is the same no matter what the link
                order. This is useful if you have only few or mis-ordered links.
